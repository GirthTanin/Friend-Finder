# Friend-Finder
This is my homework for week 13 of my Trilogy Boot Camp at the University of Pennsylvania.

##  Skill Sets Demonstrated
In this challenge I used Node and Express for the server, and then deploy it in a working state to Heroku. Learning about standardized file and folder structure was also required.

##To Fork and Play with this yourself
You will need to run *npm install* in the command line to have the node packages that will allow this to run for you.  After you have all the files, at the server.js level use `npm start` or `node server.js` to begin the fun.  Once it is running, from your browser you can interact with it at `localhost:8080/`.
